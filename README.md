# OnionEye

**An eye on the ToR Browser network... get it, Onion Eye? 👁️🧅**

## What is OnionEye?

OnionEye is a lightweight Python tool designed to skim and crawl the Tor network and regular websites, hunting down .onion and regular HTTP/HTTPS links. It’s built for cybersecurity enthusiasts, researchers, and curious minds who want to explore and analyze hidden services through the Tor proxy — all without the usual bloated overhead.

> [!WARNING]
> OnionEye fetches and scans URLs *without* executing any JavaScript, which helps keep you safer. However, some .onion sites may host malicious content.  
> **Always keep JavaScript disabled in your Tor Browser when visiting unknown or scanned links!**  
> Enabling JS on Tor can expose you to malware, tracking, and other attacks.

> [!CAUTION]
> OnionEye does not filter or block dangerous content. It is intended for research and analysis only.  
> Visiting scanned links *outside* of Tor or with unsafe settings may expose your system to risks.

## Features

- **Multi-seed crawling:** Start from multiple seed URLs and explore links recursively.
- **Tor SOCKS5 proxy support:** Route all requests safely over your local Tor proxy.
- **Link extraction:** Parses HTML to find both regular and .onion links.
- **JavaScript detection:** Quickly detects if a page requires JS (for awareness).
- **Configurable depth:** Limit how deep the crawler dives.
- **Modular and extensible:** Clean Python modules to easily tweak or extend.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
- Tor running locally with SOCKS5 proxy enabled (usually on `127.0.0.1:9050`)

---

## Setup

1. Install required Python packages:

```pip install requests beautifulsoup4```

Make sure you have Tor installed and running. On most systems:

```sudo systemctl start tor```

or launch the Tor Browser which provides the SOCKS proxy.

Update your seeds.json with your desired starting URLs.

---

# Usage

Run the crawler with ```./startscript.sh```
> [!NOTE]
> You may have to `chmod u+x startscript.sh` first

You’ll see the scan progress in your terminal with info about discovered links and whether they require JavaScript.
